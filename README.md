# The Algorithms - Haskell
Haskell is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.

### All algorithms implemented in Haskell (for education)

These implementations are for learning purposes. They may be less efficient than the implementations in the Haskell standard library.
